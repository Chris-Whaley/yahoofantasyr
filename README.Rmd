# yahoofantasyr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of yahoofantasyr is to make getting data from Yahoo Fantasy sports leagues
easy. It provides functions to access scoreboards, rosters, and team data for the 
current season.

## Installation

You can install the development version of yahoofantasyr like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(yahoofantasyr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r gamecodes}
# fantasy_football_seasons <- yf_get("games;game_codes=nfl")
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
