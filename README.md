The goal of yahoofantasyr is to make getting data from Yahoo Fantasy
sports leagues easy. It provides functions to access scoreboards,
rosters, and team data for the current season.

## Installation

You can install the development version of yahoofantasyr like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(yahoofantasyr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
# fantasy_football_seasons <- yf_get("games;game_codes=nfl")
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
